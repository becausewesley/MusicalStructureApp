# MusicalStructureApp
One of my Udacity projects- I hope some of this code can help anyone that encountered the same challenges as I did.

This app is one that I submitted to Udacity: Musical Structure App. It basically takes a list of music...and Plays each song you click on!

This may be basic stuff for an experienced developer but starting out, I had a few challenges which I was able to overcome.
I really struggled to find the right solutions online, so when I did figure it out, I decided to create a public repository to help other
novice developers like me. 

Key things in the code-base: 

1) AudioFocus (MusicPlayer.java) - which includes the usages for AudioManager and MediaPlayer.

2) Creating and implementing custom classes and objects (Song.java  &  SongAdapter.java)

3) Passing your custom class/object with intent using the Parcelable implementation (Song.java  (bottom half of the code))


I really hope this helps, if you have any questions about this app or code, or cant seem to find the above mentioned key points
